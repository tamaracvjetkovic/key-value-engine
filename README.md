# Key-Value Engine üîë‚öôÔ∏è

A console application for managing large data using a key-value engine.

---

This was a university project, done in the team of five, for the course "Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures", taken in the 3rd semester of the Software Engineering and Information Technologies program.

The ``goal`` of the project was to:
- apply acquired knowledge of advanced algorithms and data structures,
- get familiar with Go and techniques for handling large data,
- improve and optimize the overall memory usage
#
Technologies used: 
- ``Go``
#
Date: February, 2024.

# How does it work? ‚ùì
- uses advanced algorithms and data structures, like: Bloom Filter, SSTable, Memtable, Merkle Tree, Skiplist, Level-Tiered Compactions, and etc.
- stores the data in the "key-value" format,
- the application offers multiple options in the menu, like: put, get, delete, compare SSTables (using Merkle Tree), and etc.
